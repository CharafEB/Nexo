## 🚀 Usage

### **1️⃣ Creating a project with predefined structures**
```sh
c:/nexo/nexo.exe Node --Stract S --Save S project1 express mongoose
```
This command initializes a **Node.js** project with a **Standard** structure and saves it as `project1`.

### **2️⃣ Creating a custom project structure**
```sh
c:/nexo/nexo.exe Check --Stract G
```
This opens the current directory and allows you to define a custom structure.

### **3️⃣ Using a saved structure**
```sh
c:/nexo/nexo.exe Node --Stract G --Save S project2 express mongoose
```
This applies the custom structure you previously built.

### **4️⃣ Generating a project from a saved structure**
```sh
c:/nexo/nexo.exe Node project2
```
This will scaffold a project using the saved `project2` template.
